  ## Normally, only full and unique matches for queries are returned, which is best for accurate counting of hits
  ## For other purposes, such as coding tokens, it is better to return all features for which the query is true.
  ## e.g., query "a AND b" on text "a b b" will in the first case only match the first a and b, but the second be is ignored because it is not a complete match
  ## in the second case, the second b is also returned.
