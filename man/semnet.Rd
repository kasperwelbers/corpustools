\title{Create a semantic network based on the co-occurence of tokens in documents}
\usage{
semnet(
  tc,
  feature = "token",
  measure = c("con_prob", "con_prob_weighted", "cosine", "count_directed",
    "count_undirected", "chi2"),
  context_level = c("document", "sentence"),
  backbone = F,
  n.batches = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tc}{a tCorpus or a featureHits object (i.e. the result of search_features)}

\item{feature}{The name of the feature column}

\item{measure}{The similarity measure. Currently supports: "con_prob" (conditional probability), "con_prob_weighted", "cosine" similarity, "count_directed" (i.e number of cooccurrences) and "count_undirected" (same as count_directed, but returned as an undirected network, chi2 (chi-square score))}

\item{context_level}{Determine whether features need to co-occurr within "documents" or "sentences"}

\item{backbone}{If True, add an edge attribute for the backbone alpha}

\item{n.batches}{If a number, perform the calculation in batches}
}
\value{
an Igraph graph in which nodes are features and edges are similarity scores
}
\description{
This function calculates the co-occurence of features and returns a network/graph in the igraph format, where nodes are tokens and edges represent the similarity/adjacency of tokens. Co-occurence is calcuated based on how often two tokens occured within the same document (e.g., news article, chapter, paragraph, sentence). The semnet_window() function can be used to calculate co-occurrence of tokens within a given token distance.

text = c('A B C', 'D E F. G H I', 'A D', 'GGG')
